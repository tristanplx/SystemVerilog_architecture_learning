#RISC-V Processor/ Microcontroller Modeling Project 
This project involves the modeling of a simple processor or microcontroller using the RISC-V architecture and Systemverilog. The aim is to review and solidify the concepts and skills I acquired during my studies at the Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne, specifically focusing on hardware design and architecture.
